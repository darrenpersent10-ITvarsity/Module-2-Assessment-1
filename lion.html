                    <h3>LION</h3>
                   <p>The Lion also known as the "King of the Jungle" is part of the cat Family. A muscular, deep-chested cat, it has a short, rounded head, a reduced neck and round ears, and a hairytuft at the end of it's tail. The Lion is sexually dimorphic; males are larger than females with a typical weight range of 150 to 250 kg (331 to 551 lb) for the former and 120 to 182 kg (256 to 401 lb) for the latter.</p>
                   
                   <p>In addition, male lions have a prominent mane, which is the most recognisable feature of the species. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubes. Groups of female lions typically hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. Lions are apex and keystone predators, although they scavenge as opportunity allows. While lions do not typically hunt humans, some have been known to do so.</p>
