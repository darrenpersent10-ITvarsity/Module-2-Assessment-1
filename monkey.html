                    <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
                   <p>Monkey refers to "nonhuman primate mammal with the exception usually of the lemurs and tarsiers". The term especially refers to "any of the smaller longer-tailed catarrhine or platyrrhine primates as contrasted with the apes". Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most species are mainly active during the day (diurnal). Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, especially the Old World monkeys of Catarrhini.</p>
                   
                   <p>Lemurs, lorises, and galagos are not monkeys; instead they are strepsirrhine primates. Like monkeys, tarsiers are haplorhine primates; however, they are also not monkeys.</p>
                   
                   <p>Monkeys, including apes, can be distinguished from other primates by having only two pectoral nipples, and a lack of sensory whiskers.</p>
