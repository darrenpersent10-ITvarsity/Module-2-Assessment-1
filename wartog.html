                    <h3>WARTOG</h3>
                   <p>The Warthog (Phacochoerus africanus) is a wild member of the pig family (Suidae) found in Grassland, Savanna, and Woodland in Sub-Saharan Africa. In the past, it was commonly treated as a subspecies of (P. aethiopicus), but today that scientific name is restricted to the desert warthog of northern Kenya, Somalia, and eastern Ethiopia.</p>
                   
                   <p>A Warthog is identifiable by the two pairs of tusks protruding from the mouth and curving upwards. The lower pair, which is far shorter than the upper pair, becomes razor-sharp by rubbing against the upper pair every time the mouth is opened and closed. The upper canine teeth can grow to 25.5 cm (10 in) long and have a wide elliptical cross section, being about 4.5 cm (1 3⁄4 in) deep and 2.5 cm (1 in) wide. A tusk will curve 90° or more from the root, and will not lie flat on a table, as it curves somewhat backwards as it grows. The tusks are not used for digging,[6] but are used for combat with other hogs, and in defense against predators – the lower set can inflict severe wounds.</p>
